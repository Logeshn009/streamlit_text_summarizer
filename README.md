# Christograph

Christograph aims to provide a solution for researchers to build links to form a vast research community. Also with the modules like knowledge graph-based displayograph, summarizaro, and recommendation helps researchers productivity. We have academic research websites like Google Scholar, JSTOR, ResearchGate, etc. These websites only have research papers and articles but they do not have a recommendation system for researchers where researchers get recommendations based on their search and also to write their research papers. Similarly spending more time on referring to the research papers makes us little overwhelming and unproductive, instead a web app which could solve your problem where you can just upload or paste the text which needs to be summarized. Then get insights like count of text, most repeated words etc.
